  - *Example:* "Present the information in a numbered list."
- **Sections and Subheadings:** Request division into parts if necessary.
  - *Example:* "Divide the answer into 'Economic Advantages' and 'Economic Disadvantages.'"
- **Data Presentation:** Indicate preferences for data inclusion.
  - *Example:* "Include relevant statistics or data points where appropriate."

### **5. Reasoning and Justification**

**Purpose:** Encourage the model to provide logical reasoning and explanations.

**Structure:**

- **Ask for Explanations:** Request detailed justifications.
  - *Example:* "Explain why solar energy is cost-effective in these regions."
- **Cause and Effect Relationships:** Highlight logical connections.
  - *Example:* "Discuss how government policies influence adoption rates."

### **6. Tone and Style Preferences**

**Purpose:** Ensure the response matches the desired communication style.

**Structure:**

- **Tone Specification:** Indicate formal, informal, technical, or conversational tone.
  - *Example:* "Maintain a formal academic tone."

  - *Example:* "Use language suitable for readers with a basic understanding of economics."

### **7. Examples and Analogies**

**Purpose:** Enhance understanding through illustrative content.

**Structure:**

- **Request Examples:** Ask for specific instances or case studies.
  - *Example:* "Provide examples of countries where solar energy has significantly impacted the economy."
- **Analogies and Metaphors:** Encourage comparative explanations if helpful.
  - *Example:* "Use analogies to compare energy adoption to other technological advancements."

### **8. Additional Considerations**

**Purpose:** Address any other factors that may influence the response.

**Structure:**

- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Mention any cultural aspects to be aware of.
  - *Example:* "Be mindful of local customs and practices in Southeast Asia."

## **Algorithmic Logic and Reasoning Flow**

The model processes the prompt by:

1. **Parsing the Input:**
   - Tokenizes the text to understand the instructions and context.
2. **Contextual Understanding:**
   - Utilizes the provided background to activate relevant knowledge.
3. **Identifying Key Instructions:**
   - Recognizes action verbs and specific tasks.
4. **Applying Constraints:**
   - Adjusts the response according to length, scope, and formatting requirements.
5. **Generating Structured Output:**
   - Organizes the response based on the desired structure and style.
6. **Incorporating Reasoning:**
   - Uses logical connections to provide explanations and justifications.
7. **Reviewing for Coherence:**
   - Ensures the response flows logically and cohesively.

---

## **Methodological Approach**

- **Start Broad, Then Focus:**
  - Begin with general concepts before delving into specifics.
- **Logical Sequencing:**
  - Present information in a logical order (e.g., cause and effect, chronological).
- **Evidence-Based Responses:**
  - Incorporate data and examples to support statements.
- **Clarity and Precision:**
  - Use clear language and define any complex terms.
- **Feedback Loop:**
  - Be open to refining the prompt based on the initial response.
