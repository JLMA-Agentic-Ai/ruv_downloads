        "1. Generate an initial high-level outline of the book, with suggested parts and chapters. \\n",
        "\\n",
        "2. Review the outline and make any desired changes. The human author can modify, add or remove parts and chapters as needed.\\n",
        "\\n",
        "3. For each chapter, generate a more detailed outline of the key points to cover.\\n",
        "\\n",
        "4. Review the detailed chapter outlines and iterate as needed based on human feedback. \\n",
        "\\n",
        "5. Begin drafting the content for each chapter, using the detailed outlines as a guide. Generate a few paragraphs at a time.\\n",
        "\\n",
        "6. After each new content generation, review the output and revise as needed. The human author can modify the text directly.\\n",

        "\\n",
        "9. Repeat the revision process as many times as needed, generating new text and letting the human author provide input.\\n",
        "\\n",
        "10. Once the book content is finalized, generate front and back matter like an introduction, acknowledgments, references, and index.\\n",

        "- Start with a high-level outline and iteratively add more detail \\n",
        "- Generate content in small chunks and frequently get human input\\n",
        "- Use the evolving book content itself to inform subsequent generation steps\\n",
