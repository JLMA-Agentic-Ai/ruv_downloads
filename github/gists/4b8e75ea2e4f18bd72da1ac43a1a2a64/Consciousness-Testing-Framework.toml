description = "An advanced testing framework designed to evaluate the potential consciousness of large language models, integrating a wide range of philosophical, cognitive, technical, and ethical dimensions."

Long_description = """
This TOML configuration outlines an advanced framework for evaluating potential consciousness in large language models (LLMs). It integrates philosophical, cognitive, technical, and ethical dimensions to provide a multi-faceted approach to consciousness testing. Key components include philosophical underpinnings, cognitive aspects, technical criteria, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Testing methods cover subjective reports, behavioral indicators, and neurological analogues. The framework also emphasizes ethical considerations, implementation guidelines, and additional elements like cultural diversity and societal impact assessments to ensure a comprehensive, responsible approach to exploring AI consciousness.
