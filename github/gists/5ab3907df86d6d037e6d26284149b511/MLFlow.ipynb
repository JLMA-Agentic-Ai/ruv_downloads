    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning projects often involve numerous experiments, parameters, and iterations. **MLflow** is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It helps track experiments, models, and metrics, making it easier to organize and reproduce results. On the other hand, **DSPy** (Declarative Self-improving Python) is an open-source Python framework that allows developers to build language model applications using modular and declarative programming instead of relying on one-off prompting techniques. In simpler terms, DSPy lets you *program* your AI rather than just prompt it, enabling more structured and optimizable AI behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will introduce beginners to an AI/ML workflow that combines MLflow and DSPy. You'll learn how to set up your environment, manage sensitive API keys (using Google Colab's Secrets and OpenRouter), organize your code and data, integrate a dataset, train and optimize a model, evaluate its performance, and finally deploy the model. Throughout, we'll highlight best practices for reproducibility, experiment tracking, and modular coding. By the end, you should understand how MLflow can track your machine learning experiments and how DSPy can help build and refine AI model logic as code."

Google Colab provides a **Secrets** feature that allows you to securely store API keys and retrieve them in your code. You can add secrets by clicking on the \"Secrets\" icon in Colab, then entering a name (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`) and its value. Once stored, a secret can be accessed from your notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "Writing modular code means breaking down your project into reusable components (functions, classes, modules) instead of writing one long script. This approach makes it easier to read, debug, and reuse code. For instance, you might have one function to preprocess data, another to train a model, and another to evaluate results. This modular structure is especially useful in machine learning projects where you may try multiple approaches. DSPy itself encourages a modular approach by letting you define *modules* for each part of an AI task."

    "- **Track Everything**: Use MLflow to log parameters, code versions, data versions, metrics, and artifacts. This makes your work reproducible and easier to debug.\n",
    "- **Reproducibility**: Ensure that your experiments are reproducible by fixing random seeds, pinning package versions, and capturing environment details.\n",
    "- **Version Control**: Keep your code in version control (e.g., Git). Log commit hashes in MLflow for traceability.\n",
    "- **Modular Design**: Write modular code to isolate and reuse components across projects.\n",
    "- **Testing and Validation**: Validate your model and code with appropriate testing methods.\n",
    "- **Model Registry & Deployment**: Manage model versions using a registry and automate deployment when possible.\n",
    "- **Continuous Monitoring**: Once deployed, continuously monitor your model's performance to address data drift or model decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these practices, you create a robust ML workflow. MLflow handles tracking and reproducibility, while DSPy enables you to build and optimize AI modules in a modular, programmable way. Together, these tools empower rapid prototyping and innovation in AI."
