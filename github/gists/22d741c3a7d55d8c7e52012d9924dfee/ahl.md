## AI Hacking League Official Rules

### 1. Competition Format

The AI Hacking League consists of timed challenges where participants build AI applications within strict time limits. Challenges are categorized as follows:

- **Sprint**: 15 minutes
- **Dash**: 30 minutes
- **Marathon**: 60 minutes

### 2. Team Composition

- Participants may compete solo or in teams of up to three members.
- Team roles are flexible but typically include:
  - UI/UX Developer
  - Algorithm/Middleware Specialist
  - DevOps/Integration Engineer

## Time Tracking

The AI Hacking League employs a sophisticated AI-powered system to ensure precise and fair time tracking for all challenges. This system is designed to monitor and log every crucial moment of the competition, from start to finish.

### Initial Check-in

Participants must check in via the official league platform before the challenge starts[1]. This pre-challenge check-in logs the exact time participants begin, ensuring a fair start for all competitors. The system uses real-time monitoring to log the time usage during competitions, creating an immutable record of each participant's activity[3].

### Commit Tracking

The league utilizes Git for version control, allowing easy tracking of commits with timestamps. An automated timestamp logging system is implemented for each commit to ensure accuracy. This creates a streamlined interface for participants to check their commit history during competitions, providing transparency and accountability.

### Challenge Progression

Throughout the challenge, the AI system provides:

- Automated countdown timers with alerts for participants
- Interactive dashboards showing time remaining and progress for each participant/team
- AI-based anomaly detection to monitor participant activities and ensure compliance with league rules

### Challenge Conclusion

The challenge concludes automatically when time expires. The system logs the final commit timestamp, marking the official end of the participant's work. To prevent any discrepancies, the system sets up alerts for starting and stopping the timer in real-time.

### Additional Features

The AI-powered time tracking system also includes:

- Integration with cloud services for centralized time management
- Support for multi-time zone tracking for international participants
- Historical data analysis capabilities for optimizing future competitions

By leveraging these advanced AI features, the league ensures a fair, transparent, and efficient time tracking process that maintains the integrity of each challenge while providing participants with real-time information about their progress.
