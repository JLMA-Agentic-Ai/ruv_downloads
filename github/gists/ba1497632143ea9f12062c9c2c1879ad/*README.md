# Getting Started with ChatGPT Codex + Mastra Agents

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open the ChatGPT Codex task setup panel.**
   This is where you configure your environment before starting a task.

2. **Locate the "Setup Script" field.**
   You’ll see a note that internet access is disabled *after* the script runs.

3. **Copy and paste the full contents of your `setup.sh` into the setup field.**
   This will install the necessary tools, clone your repository, set up SPARC, and create your Mastra agent.

4. **Run the task.**
   The setup script will execute at the beginning. After that, internet access is shut off.

5. **Begin coding with your Codex agent.**
   Use the preloaded Mastra agent to help structure, refine, and test your code within the offline environment.

6. **Check `/workspace` for all generated files.**
   Code, tests, logs, and output will be organized per SPARC standards.

## Notes

* You don’t need to install anything manually.
* Make sure your script includes everything needed before internet access is disabled.
* The Mastra agent will guide and optimize your code development and testing
