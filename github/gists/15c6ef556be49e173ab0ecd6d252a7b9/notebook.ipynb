We will build a system where an AI agent can modify its own code and strategies, verify those modifications with formal proofs, and orchestrate a team of sub-agents (code generator, tester, reviewer) to improve code automatically. The notebook covers:\n\n- **Gödel Agent Constructs:** Designing an agent that can **self-rewrite** its code and perform **meta-learning** (learning to improve itself) while avoiding infinite recursion.\n- **Extended Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI) Framework:** Creating feedback loops for the agent to refine its inference rules and task-solving strategies over multiple iterations, using tools like **DSPy** for automatic prompt optimization.\n- **Automated Proof and Verification:** Integrating formal reasoning tools (e.g., Z3 SMT solver, and conceptually Coq/Lean theorem provers) to **verify logical correctness** of any self-modification **before** it is applied.\n- **Multi-Agent Orchestration with LangGraph & CrewAI:** Coordinating multiple specialized agents (Code Generator, Tester, Reviewer) under the Gödel Agent's supervision, using a **modular YAML pipeline** and employing reinforcement learning techniques (GSPO, BootStrapFewShot, COPRO) to optimize their collaboration.\n- **Comprehensive Documentation & Execution Pipeline:** Step-by-step instructions, code examples, and a full workflow from installation to deployment. We include guidance on using the pipeline via a user interface or command-line, and how to benchmark and save the optimized agent for reuse.\n\n**Note:** This is a PhD-level tutorial. We assume familiarity with Python, machine learning, and basics of formal logic. Each section builds on the previous, culminating in a working prototype of a self-improving code assistant. Let's begin by installing necessary packages and setting up our environment.\n",

Gödel Agent Constructs\n\nA **Gödel Agent** is an AI agent that can modify (rewrite) its own code when it determines an improvement is possible, drawing inspiration from the theoretical Gödel Machine&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. This requires the agent to operate on *two levels*:\n\n- **Object-level:** solving tasks using its current code (policy).\n- **Meta-level:** reasoning about and potentially improving its own code (self-rewriting).\n\nCrucially, a Gödel Agent only self-modifies when it can formally prove the new version will perform better (or at least not worse) than the current one&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. This avoids random or harmful changes. The agent uses **meta-learning** (\"learning to learn\") to analyze its performance and derive improvements&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.\n\nTo prevent infinite recursion of self-improvement, the agent follows strict constraints:\n- It must produce a formal **proof of benefit** (e.g., faster runtime or higher accuracy) before applying any code change&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.\n- It limits the frequency or depth of self-modification. For example, it may only self-rewrite when a certain performance threshold is met, and then continue solving tasks with the new code. This way, it doesn't get stuck in an endless loop of rewriting without making progress.\n\nLet's implement a simple Gödel Agent in Python. Our agent will have a function (method) to solve a task, and a meta-method to attempt to improve that function. We'll use a toy problem: summing integers from 1 to *n*. The agent starts with a naive implementation and will try to replace it with a more efficient one. We will integrate a formal verification step using a symbolic reasoning tool (Sympy, as a stand-in for Coq/Lean or Z3) to ensure the new method is correct before adopting it.\n",

      "source": "**Explanation:** In the code above, the Gödel Agent starts with `slow_sum` (a loop) and then proposes `formula_sum` as an improvement. The `verify_improvement` method uses a symbolic math approach to prove that the new method is mathematically equivalent to the old one for all nonnegative *n*. Since the proof succeeds (difference simplifies to 0), the agent replaces its `strategy` with `formula_sum`. We measure performance before and after — the new strategy runs in constant time, providing a significant speedup.\n\nThis toy example demonstrates **self-rewriting**: the agent effectively changed its own code to a better version after a proof of correctness. In a more complex scenario, the `propose_improvement()` step could involve an LLM proposing code changes or a search through a space of algorithms. The key is that *any proposed change must pass a rigorous verification*, ensuring the agent doesn't harm its performance or enter an infinite rewrite loop. If no improvement can be proven, the agent continues with its current code (preventing infinite self-modification loops by design).\n\nNext, we'll extend this idea into a more general **Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI)** framework, where the agent not only improves a single function but can refine its entire problem-solving strategy over multiple iterations.\n",

      "source": "## 2. Extended Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI) Framework\n\nRecursive Self-Improvement (RSI) is a process in which an early or weak **artificial general intelligence** (AGI) system enhances its own capabilities and intelligence without human intervention, leading to a **superintelligence** or **intelligence explosion**&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}. In our framework, the Gödel Agent not only tweaks a single function, but can adjust its reasoning **policies and inference rules** across tasks. This involves:\n\n- **Meta-Management:** The agent monitors its performance on tasks and maintains meta-level rules for when and how to self-improve. For instance, it might decide to refine its strategy after accumulating enough experience or if performance drops below a threshold.\n- **Dynamic Strategy Rewriting:** The agent can rewrite its own **task-solving strategy** (prompting approach, tool usage, code generation tactics, etc.) based on feedback. This could mean changing how it breaks down a problem or which sub-algorithms it uses.\n- **Feedback Loops:** After each iteration of solving tasks and possibly improving itself, the agent observes the outcomes (e.g., success/failure, efficiency metrics) and feeds this back into its meta-learning module. This loop allows **extended RSI**, where improvements compound over time.\n\nTo facilitate automated strategy optimization, we can leverage **DSPy (Declarative Self-Improving Python)**&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}. DSPy is a framework that treats prompt engineering as a program optimization problem. Instead of brittle prompts, we write compositional Python code and use DSPy to teach our LM to deliver high-quality outputs. DSPy provides **teleprompter optimizers** that iteratively refine prompts and few-shot examples using feedback from the model's own outputs. In essence, DSPy helps our agent **learn better prompts and strategies over multiple iterations**.\n\n### Using DSPy for Prompt and Execution Optimization\n\nLet's outline how we could integrate DSPy into our RSI agent:\n1. **Define a Baseline Program:** Represent the task pipeline (e.g., code generation followed by testing) in DSPy as a composition of modules (each module could correspond to a sub-task or a chain-of-thought step).\n2. **Initial Prompt/Strategy:** Provide an initial prompt or logic for each module (this is analogous to the Gödel Agent's starting strategy).\n3. **Apply Optimizers:** Use DSPy's teleprompter optimizers to improve the program:\n   - **BootstrapFewShot:** Automatically generate and select few-shot examples to include in prompts&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}. This uses the model itself to produce candidate input-output examples and evaluates them with a metric to decide if they are worth keeping in the prompt.\n   - **COPRO (Cooperative Prompt Optimization):** Refine the instructions and output formatting for each module&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}. COPRO tries variations of the task instructions and output prefixes, evaluating on a validation set to find more effective phrasing.\n   - **GSPO (Goal-Specific Prompt Optimization):** A conceptual RL-style approach where we define a reward for the overall task success (e.g., code passes all tests) and let the agent experiment with prompt variations to maximize this reward.\n4. **Iterate:** After applying an optimizer, evaluate the improved program on tasks. If metrics improve, accept the changes; otherwise, revert or try different optimization strategies. The agent can continue to iterate, further tuning prompts or strategies as needed, forming an extended self-improvement loop at the prompt/policy level.\n\n**DSPy in action:** For example, using `dspy.teleprompt.BootstrapFewShot`, we can write:\n```python\nfrom dspy.teleprompt import BootstrapFewShot\ntele = BootstrapFewShot(metric=my_metric_function, metric_threshold=0.9)\noptimized_program = tele.compile(original_program, trainset=my_train_data)\n```\nThis will have the agent generate its own examples and include those that meet the performance threshold. Similarly, using `COPRO`:\n```python\nfrom dspy.teleprompt import COPRO\ntele2 = COPRO(metric=my_metric_function, verbose=True)\noptimized_program = tele2.compile(original_program, trainset=my_train_data)\n```\nThis will adjust the instructions given to the language model for each step.\n\nBy looping this process (and possibly combining multiple optimizers), the Gödel Agent's approach to tasks becomes more effective over time. Each iteration is essentially a **self-improvement step** guided by feedback, analogous to how our simple agent improved its code.\n\nIt's critical that after each change, we ensure the agent's performance **did not regress**. This check prevents the system from making a change that harms its capabilities.\n\nIn summary, the extended RSI framework enables the Gödel Agent to manage its own learning process: not only modifying its code, but also evolving how it **thinks** and orchestrates tasks. Next, we will discuss how we enforce logical correctness at each self-modification using formal proof techniques, to maintain trust in the system.\n",

      "source": "## 3. Automated Proof and Verification\n\nWhen an agent can modify itself, rigorous checks are needed to ensure it remains correct. We integrate **automated proof and verification** steps into the pipeline so that any self-modification is validated before execution:\n\n- **Logical Equivalence:** We ensure that an improved algorithm yields the same results as the original for all possible inputs (or the inputs of interest). In our example, we used Sympy to symbolically prove the sum formula. In general, we could use an SMT solver like **Z3** to assert properties (e.g., the outputs of new vs old code are equal for all inputs up to some bound, or that certain invariants hold) and check satisfiability.\n- **Theorem Proving:** For critical components, we can employ interactive theorem provers like **Coq** or **Lean**. These allow us to write formal proofs. For example, one could formalize: `∀n ≥ 0, slow_sum(n) = formula_sum(n)` and prove it in Coq. Only after such a proof would the agent trust the new code. This aligns with the concept of a Gödel machine requiring a proof of improvement&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.\n- **Preventing Errors:** The verification step should also ensure the new code doesn't introduce runtime errors (like division by zero, out-of-bounds, etc.) or violate any constraints the agent must follow (like time complexity limits or memory bounds, if those are specified).\n\nIn practice, integrating a full theorem prover in the loop can be complex, but it's feasible for certain well-defined improvements. There are real-world precedents: **CompCert**, a C compiler, is formally verified using Coq, meaning each optimization is proved to preserve the semantics of the program being compiled&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}. Similarly, our Gödel Agent only applies a change after proving it preserves or improves correctness.\n\nIn our example, the verification was straightforward (summing arithmetic series). For more complex code, the agent might rely on a combination of unit tests and formal methods:\n- Use property-based testing (quickly test many random cases) for a quick check.\n- Then use an SMT solver to check logical conditions or equivalences for a generalized form or within certain domains.\n- Optionally, generate a formal proof script for a theorem prover and attempt to discharge it automatically.\n\nBy gating self-improvement with these checks, we create a **safety net**. The agent will not evolve into an incorrect state because every modification is vetted. This approach addresses the classic concern of recursive self-improvement: that an AI might inadvertently corrupt itself. Here, the Gödel Agent's changes are always logically verified, maintaining trust in the system.\n\nNow, having covered self-improvement and safety, let's scale up our system to involve multiple agents working together on coding tasks, under the supervision of our Gödel Agent.\n",

      "source": "## 4. Multi-Agent Orchestration with LangGraph & CrewAI\n\nOur pipeline can be enhanced by involving specialized agents collaborating on tasks, with the Gödel Agent orchestrating the process. Consider a scenario where we have:\n- A **Code Generator** agent that writes code given a problem description.\n- A **Tester** agent that runs tests on the generated code.\n- A **Reviewer** agent that examines the code and test results, providing feedback.\n\nThe Gödel Agent can coordinate these roles using frameworks like **LangGraph** and **CrewAI**. **LangGraph** enables defining workflows where agents (or model calls) are nodes in a graph, supporting loops for retries or improvements&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}. **CrewAI** provides a convenient YAML-based configuration to define agents and their interactions&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}, making complex multi-agent orchestration easier to manage.\n\n**Pipeline Workflow:**\n1. **Problem Input:** The Gödel Agent receives a specification of the problem (for example, \"write a function to compute the sum of 1..n\").\n2. **Code Generation:** It delegates to the Code Generator agent, which uses an LLM (like GPT-4 or a fine-tuned model) to generate initial code.\n3. **Testing:** The Tester agent executes the code with sample test cases. In CrewAI, this agent might have access to a Python tool to run code. The output (pass/fail, errors, etc.) is collected.\n4. **Review:** The Reviewer agent (another LLM prompt) reviews the code and the test results. It might suggest changes, optimizations, or point out errors.\n5. **Feedback Loop:** If the Reviewer suggests improvements or if any test failed, the Gödel Agent loops back to prompt the Code Generator to refine the code (providing the feedback as context). This can repeat for a few iterations until the code passes tests and the review is satisfied.\n6. **Completion:** Once the code is correct and optimized, the process ends with a final approved code solution.\n\nWe can formalize this with a **YAML pipeline configuration** in CrewAI. For example:\n```yaml\nagents:\n  coder:\n    role: \"Software Developer AI\"\n    llm: \"gpt-4\"\n  tester:\n    role: \"QA Tester AI\"\n    llm: \"gpt-4\"\n    tools: [\"python\"]\n  reviewer:\n    role: \"Code Reviewer AI\"\n    llm: \"gpt-4\"\nflows:\n  - name: \"CodeOptimizationFlow\"\n    steps:\n      - agent: coder\n        prompt: |\n          You are {role}. Write Python code to solve the following task:\n          {task_description}\n      - agent: tester\n        prompt: |\n          You are {role}. Test the given code with appropriate cases and report any failures or errors.\n      - agent: reviewer\n        prompt: |\n          You are {role}. Review the code and test results. If improvements can be made or bugs exist, provide feedback.\n      - agent: coder\n        prompt: |\n          You are {role}. Improve the code based on the following feedback:\n          {reviewer_feedback}\n        condition: \"{{ reviewer_feedback | contains('Suggest') or reviewer_feedback | contains('failed') }}\"\n```\nIn this YAML, the workflow is clearly laid out. The `condition` ensures that the improvement step only runs if the Reviewer indicated suggestions or test failures. CrewAI would interpret this and automatically loop back the flow as needed, enabling multiple iterations.\n\n**LangGraph** similarly can represent this as a graph with a cycle from the review node back to the code generation node until exit conditions are met. LangGraph emphasizes the structure and dependencies of tasks, and it supports real-time streaming of results and easier debugging of agent interactions.\n\nIn either framework, the Gödel Agent is effectively the conductor of this multi-agent orchestra. It sets up the agents, provides the problem, and ensures the loop runs. The Gödel Agent can also have a meta-role here: analyzing how many loops were needed, what kind of feedback was repeatedly appearing, etc., and then adjusting strategies (this ties back into RSI — the Gödel Agent might tweak the prompts of the sub-agents over time, e.g., by integrating DSPy to optimize them, or learning an RL policy to decide when to stop iterating).\n\n### Reinforcement Learning for Orchestration\n\nWe can assign a reward to the whole multi-agent process, such as +1 if the task is solved within a certain number of iterations (or a higher reward for fewer iterations), and 0 if not solved. Over many tasks, the Gödel Agent could use RL (e.g., a policy gradient method) to learn how to better utilize the sub-agents. For example, it might learn to call the Tester with specific edge cases proactively, or to prompt the Reviewer to be stricter or more lenient depending on context. The mention of **GSPO** in our design comes into play here: one can imagine a \"Goal-directed Self-Prompt Optimization\" where the goal is to minimize iterations or maximize correctness, and the orchestration strategy is tuned accordingly.\n\nHowever, even without an explicit RL loop, the combination of DSPy prompt optimization and multi-agent feedback forms a kind of implicit RL: the system tries different prompt tweaks (actions) and sees if the outcome (reward = solved code) improves.\n\nTo illustrate multi-agent orchestration, let's simulate a single loop of the process with our sum example. (In an actual run, these would be separate LLM calls; here we'll just mock their behavior.)\n",

In a realistic scenario, you might output the entire solved code or model prompts to files.\n\n### Benchmarking and A/B Testing\n\nTo truly validate recursive self-improvement, we should measure performance improvements. Some strategies:\n- **Execution Time:** We measured the time for summation before and after optimization. We saw a large speedup for large *n*. Similarly, for generated code, we could measure execution speed or memory usage of initial vs optimized code.\n- **Success Rate:** If we have a suite of tasks, we could see how many tasks the agent solves with and without self-improvement. (For example, does enabling COPRO and BootStrapFewShot yield higher correctness across coding problems?)\n- **Iteration Count:** Track how many feedback loop iterations are needed before a solution is accepted. A better strategy should reduce this.\n- **Quality of Solutions:** If there are quality metrics (like code complexity, readability, or compliance with standards), we can compare initial vs final solutions.\n\n**A/B Testing:** We could run the pipeline in two modes on a set of problems: one with the RSI features turned off (no self-modification, no prompt optimization) and one with them on. By comparing the outcomes, we can attribute performance gains to the RSI approach.\n\nIn our simple example, the improvement is clear: the computational complexity went from O(n) to O(1) after self-improvement. In more complex cases, improvements might be more subtle, but over many trials, the agent should demonstrate learning.\n\n### Saving and Reusing the Improved Agent\n\nIt's important to persist the agent's improvements so we don't have to re-learn them each time:\n- **Saving Strategies/Prompts:** After using DSPy optimizers, save the optimized prompt templates or example lists (perhaps to a YAML or JSON config). Next run, load them so the agent starts with that knowledge.\n- **Model Fine-tuning:** If any sub-agent was fine-tuned or if an RL policy was learned for orchestration, those weights should be saved (e.g., as a `.pt` PyTorch model or similar) and reloaded in subsequent sessions.\n- **Logging Changes:** The Gödel Agent can maintain a log of improvements made (like a changelog). For example, \"Replaced slow_sum with formula_sum on 2025-02-08 after proof of correctness.\" Such logs can help users trust the changes and also debug if needed.\n- **Exporting Configurations:** With CrewAI, you might export the final YAML pipeline that incorporates any prompt changes or new tools added during the run.\n\nIn our scenario, saving the code to `sum_n_optimized.py` is a trivial example of persisting an improvement. In a larger system, persistence might involve databases or cloud storage, depending on context.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe developed a comprehensive, step-by-step implementation of a Gödel Agent in a code optimization pipeline. We started from the theoretical foundations of self-referential learning machines&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13} and recursive self-improvement&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}, and built a practical system that:\n- Improves its own code through meta-learning and formal verification (preventing errors and infinite loops).\n- Utilizes modern prompt optimization techniques (DSPy)&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15} to refine its problem-solving strategy over multiple iterations.\n- Orchestrates multiple specialized agents in a feedback loop to ensure solutions are correct and optimized, employing frameworks like CrewAI&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16} and introducing the possibility of reinforcement learning in the loop&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}.\n\nThe end result is an AI pipeline that not only solves coding problems but gets better at solving them with experience, while providing guarantees of correctness. This kind of system could be extended to many domains beyond code, wherever an AI can benefit from reflection and self-improvement.\n\n**Real-world applications:** Imagine an AI that designs algorithms, proves their properties, and iteratively improves them – this could assist human engineers in discovering efficient solutions (as seen with systems like DeepMind's AlphaDev finding new sorting algorithms). Or consider autonomous research agents that propose hypotheses and verify them with theorem provers. The combination of search (via learning) and strict verification creates a powerful and safe AI loop.\n\nFeel free to experiment with the provided code, try new tasks, or integrate different tools. Each component of this tutorial can be enhanced: the Gödel Agent could attempt more complex improvements, the verification could be made more rigorous, and the multi-agent loop can tackle more ambitious programming challenges. This framework sets the stage for **trustworthy recursive self-improvement** in AI systems – a step toward machines that continually learn to become more intelligent in a controlled, verifiable manner.\n",
