Quantum magnetic navigation uses a compact quantum magnetometer to detect Earth’s natural magnetic anomalies as passive landmarks. By matching sensor readings to preloaded magnetic maps, robots and vehicles achieve GPS‑level positioning without emitting signals. It operates indoors, underwater, and in GPS‑denied or jammed environments, offering stealth, resilience, and continuous accuracy.
