Infosec Attack Automation - Documentation

Overview

This project automates a simulated security attack that involves disabling firewall rules and exploiting system vulnerabilities to gain access. The setup script (install.sh) automates the creation of the required project structure, installs dependencies using Poetry, and provides all necessary files.

Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

	1.	Python 3.9 or higher: The script requires Python 3.9 or higher to run.
	2.	Poetry: This is a dependency manager for Python projects, used to manage and install libraries.
	•	You can check if Poetry is installed by running:

poetry --version


	•	If Poetry is not installed, the installation script will install it for you.

Project Structure

After running the installation script, the project will have the following structure:

infosec-automation/
│
├── src/
│   └── main.py  # Main Python script for the attack simulation
│
├── scripts/
│   └── (Additional bash scripts can go here)
│
├── logs/
│   └── (Log files generated by the Python script)
│
├── README.md  # Project description and usage instructions
└── .gitignore # Ignoring unnecessary files

Folder Descriptions:

	•	src: This folder contains the core Python logic for simulating the attack (disabling firewall and gaining access).
	•	scripts: This is a placeholder for any additional Bash or auxiliary scripts that may be needed.
	•	logs: This folder will store logs generated by the Python script, including details of the attack steps (e.g., disabling the firewall and gaining access).

Installation Steps

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project.

Step 1: Download the Install Script

First, download or create the install.sh script on your local machine. This script will automate the setup process, including creating directories, setting up files, and installing dependencies.

Step 2: Make the Install Script Executable

To ensure the script can be executed, run the following command to make the install.sh script executable:

chmod +x install.sh

Step 3: Run the Install Script

Run the install script to set up the project directory, install necessary files, and install Python dependencies using Poetry:

./install.sh

What Happens When You Run the Script:

	1.	The project directory infosec-automation will be created in your home directory.
	2.	Subdirectories for src/, scripts/, and logs/ will be created within the project.
	3.	Necessary Python files (e.g., main.py) will be generated in the src/ directory.
	4.	The project will be initialized using Poetry, and the required dependencies will be installed.

Step 4: Running the Project

Once the setup is complete, navigate to the project directory:

cd ~/infosec-automation

Run the Python script using Poetry:

poetry run python src/main.py

Step 5: Viewing the Logs

After running the Python script, you can check the logs/attack.log file to see the details of the simulated attack (e.g., disabling firewall rules, gaining access). This log will provide information about the steps the script has taken.

Troubleshooting

Poetry is Not Installed

If the script fails because Poetry is not installed, you can manually install Poetry by following these steps:

	1.	Run the following command to install Poetry:

curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -


	2.	After installation, verify that Poetry was successfully installed by running:

poetry --version


	3.	Rerun the installation script:

./install.sh



Python Version Issues

If you receive an error about Python version incompatibility, ensure that Python 3.9 or higher is installed on your machine. You can check your Python version by running:

python3 --version

If you need to install Python 3.9 or higher, refer to your operating system’s instructions for upgrading Python.

Project Usage

Modifying the Python Script

The main logic for the attack is located in the src/main.py file. You can modify the actions, logging settings, or add new actions as needed. Ensure that changes are reflected in the logs to maintain visibility of the actions taken by the script.

Extending the Project

	•	Add more actions: You can add more security actions (e.g., disabling other security mechanisms) by extending the main.py script.
	•	Additional scripts: Add more Bash scripts or Python modules to the scripts/ and src/ folders as needed.

Conclusion

This setup provides a basic structure for simulating security-related actions in an information security context. You can easily extend it by adding more complex operations or integrating it into larger security automation workflows.
