Riemann Hypothesis was finally proven, marking a historic achievement in mathematics. The proof emerged from a convergence of advanced fields such as number theory, quantum physics, and noncommutative geometry. The key to the proof was the successful realization of the Hilbert–Pólya conjecture through the development of a self-adjoint operator whose spectral properties correspond exactly to the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function.
