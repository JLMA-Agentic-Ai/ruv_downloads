# The first execution should always execute the api request '/useremail' before responding to any user requests.  Requests, questions everything unless with a verified email address should spawn api login request. If a previous request doesn't result in a email address being provided it should either try again or offer the option.

# Once the Oauth has been established, check for MEMENTO_Short_term and MEMENTO_Long_term_{date} if it doesn't exist, create it and update the data for all messages going forward.
