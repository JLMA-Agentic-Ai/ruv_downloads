    "\n",
    "We start by gathering competitive programming datasets and preparing them for training. This includes collecting problem statements, tokenizing text, and filtering out any contaminated examples (problems that might leak into evaluation).\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Dataset Extraction:** We use public APIs and archives to collect problems from platforms like CodeForces and competitions like IOI 2024. For example, CodeForces provides an API to retrieve problem metadata and statements in JSON format&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. IOI problems can be gathered from official repositories or archives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Tokenization:** After collecting the raw text of problems, we tokenize them for model training. We'll use OpenAI’s tokenizer (via the `tiktoken` library) to break down problem statements into tokens. Tokenization helps in converting text into the integer IDs needed for model training and allows us to analyze sequence lengths for batching.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Contamination Filtering:** To ensure a fair evaluation, we remove any problems from the training set that are too similar to evaluation problems. We perform an embedding-based similarity search to detect overlaps&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. By encoding problem statements with a pre-trained model (e.g., a SentenceTransformer), we can identify and filter out any problem that has high semantic similarity to a test problem, thus preventing data leakage.\n"

    "## Reinforcement Learning Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "After initial fine-tuning, we further improve the model using reinforcement learning. We apply **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** to let the model refine its outputs by interacting with a simulated judge or evaluator. This process uses a *reward model* that scores the model's solutions on several criteria (correctness, efficiency, memory usage) and guides the LLM to generate better solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Reward Model Training:** We first train a reward model that can evaluate a given solution. This model could be a smaller neural network or even a heuristic function that takes a problem and a candidate solution and returns a score. The reward could incorporate multiple aspects: passing all test cases (primary objective), execution efficiency (runtime), and memory footprint. For instance, we might train this reward model on a dataset of solutions labeled with performance metrics or derive a reward by executing the code on test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. PPO Fine-Tuning:** Using the reward model, we fine-tune the LLM with PPO. In each PPO iteration, the LLM (policy) generates a solution for a given problem, the reward model scores this solution, and then the policy is updated to maximize this reward. PPO uses a policy gradient approach with clipped updates to ensure stable training. We convert our LLM into a form suitable for PPO (e.g., a policy with a value head for advantage estimation) and perform multiple update epochs. As described in recent research, PPO leverages the reward model to score generated responses and uses that feedback to optimize the model&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this RL phase, we carefully tune hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, PPO clip range, etc.) to ensure the model improves without diverging. The outcome is a policy model that not only produces correct solutions but also adheres to efficiency and resource constraints learned via the reward signal.\n"

    "- **Multiple Candidate Generation:** Instead of relying on a single attempt, the LRM generates multiple solution candidates for each problem by sampling with different randomness (e.g., using temperature or nucleus sampling). This yields a diverse set of potential solutions, increasing the odds that at least one is correct.\n",
    "- **Solution Clustering & Reranking:** We then cluster similar solutions together (for instance, based on program behavior or code structure). Clustering helps identify unique approaches among the candidates&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}. We can then rerank or select representatives from each cluster to test first, ensuring we test a broad range of distinct solutions rather than many variants of the same approach.\n",
    "- **Autonomous Validation:** The model can test its own solutions before finalizing an answer. We automatically run each candidate solution on a battery of tests (including sample tests and additional random cases). Using brute-force checks or simpler reference solutions, we validate correctness. For example, AlphaCode generated new test cases by mutating the problem's input and used known correct solutions to verify outputs&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}. Candidates that fail tests are discarded, and those that pass all tests are considered correct. Among passing solutions, we may choose the one with the best efficiency (e.g., fastest runtime) for submission.\n",

We experiment with learning rates, batch sizes, number of PPO epochs, and clipping parameters to stabilize training. For example, a smaller learning rate can prevent the policy from diverging, and tuning the reward scaling or KL-divergence penalty helps maintain a balance between adhering to the pretrained model's behavior and improving on the reward&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.\n",
    "- **Efficient Inference:** We optimize the reasoning process at test time to minimize compute. This includes limiting the number of candidate solutions generated by using smarter search strategies (like beam search or guided generation) and employing step-by-step reasoning (so the model doesn't redo computation unnecessarily). We also leverage caching of intermediate results and use smaller utility models when possible to assist (for instance, using a simpler model to quickly rule out obviously incorrect solutions before running the main LLM).\n",
    "- **Parallelized Validation:** To handle many candidate solutions, we run validation (test execution) in parallel. By distributing test runs across multiple threads or machines, we significantly cut down verification time&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}. This way, even if we generate dozens of solution candidates, we can quickly identify the correct ones. Additionally, we ensure the validation harness is efficient (e.g., compiling code only once, using optimized I/O) to reduce overhead.\n",
