A PyTorch implementation of a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model resembling the Mixtral 8x7B architecture, with detailed inline comments. This model combines transformer layers with an MoE layer consisting of 8 experts, aiming for high efficiency by activating only 2 experts per token. It's configured with dimensions reflecting the operational efficiency of a downscaled GPT-4 model, potentially suitable for a variety of AI tasks requiring adaptability and reduced computational load.
