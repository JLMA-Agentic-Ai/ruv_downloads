    "# MoBA: Mixture of Block Attention - Implementation & Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard self-attention in Transformers has quadratic time and memory complexity $O(N^2)$ with respect to sequence length. This becomes a bottleneck for long-context processing. To address this, *Mixture of Block Attention (MoBA)* introduces a sparse attention mechanism that divides the sequence into blocks and uses a learned gating network to select a few relevant blocks to attend for each query token. MoBA follows the principles of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to allow the model to dynamically decide where to attend, rather than relying on a fixed pattern. This approach preserves model flexibility while greatly reducing the computation for long sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we implement MoBA from scratch in PyTorch and integrate it into a Transformer model. We then benchmark its efficiency against standard self-attention and visualize its behavior. Finally, we demonstrate how to train and use a model with MoBA attention on a sample task. The steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Full Implementation of MoBA** – defining the MoBA attention mechanism with block partitioning, gating, and efficient attention computation. \n",
    "2. **Integration into a Transformer** – modifying a Transformer layer to use MoBA in place of standard attention, ensuring compatibility with Hugging Face's design (no change in parameter shapes).\n",
    "3. **Benchmarking Against Standard Attention** – comparing MoBA's computational cost to full self-attention on synthetic long sequences, with performance metrics.\n",
    "4. **Efficiency and Visualization** – plotting attention computation time vs sequence length, and visualizing how MoBA selects blocks via its gating mechanism.\n",
    "5. **Usage Example** – training and evaluating a sample model using MoBA to demonstrate its usage in practice.\n",

    "## 1. Implementing MoBA Attention Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "MoBA modifies the standard attention by limiting each query to attend only a subset of all keys, chosen via a learned gating mechanism. The sequence is partitioned into fixed-size blocks, and each query token dynamically selects a few blocks to focus on. This selection is done per attention head and respects causal order (no attending to future tokens) for autoregressive models. The main components are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Block Partitioning**: Split the keys and values into blocks of a fixed size $B$. For example, a sequence of length $N$ will be divided into $n = N/B$ blocks. This reduces the granularity of attention to block-level units. Each block will have a representative key used for gating.\n",
    "- **Gating Network**: Compute a *mean pooled* key for each block (averaging the key vectors within the block) to get a summary of that block's content. Then for each query token, compute dot-product scores between the query and each block's pooled key. This produces a set of gating scores indicating how relevant each block is to the query. A causal mask is applied to these scores to prevent attending to any block that comes *after* the query's block (disallowing future context).\n",
    "- **Top-k Block Selection**: For each query, select the top $k$ scoring blocks according to the gated scores (including the query's own block). These will be the blocks that the query actually attends to, rather than the entire sequence. By selecting only a few blocks (out of $n$), the attention computation is greatly reduced. The query's current block is always included in the selection to ensure local context is attended (even if its score is low).\n",
    "- **Efficient Attention Computation**: Compute the attention output using only the keys/values from the selected blocks. MoBA handles the query's *current block* separately with a standard (causal) attention within that block, and the *selected blocks* with another attention computation. These partial results are then combined. In practice, this can be implemented with efficient kernels (like FlashAttention) for each block group. Here we will implement it directly in PyTorch for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll implement the MoBA attention as a PyTorch `nn.Module`. This will involve creating the gating mechanism and computing the sparse attention over selected blocks.\n"

    "MoBA's efficiency advantage becomes apparent as sequence length grows. In our timing tests, full attention's runtime increases roughly quadratically with sequence length, while MoBA's runtime grows much more slowly (approximately linear for fixed block size and $k$). The printout above shows that at larger $N$, MoBA is considerably faster. This matches the trends reported in the MoBA paper, where MoBA achieved significant speedups for sequences up to 1M tokens. (Note: our Python implementation is not as optimized as the official implementation, which uses fused kernels, so absolute times can be further improved.)\n",

    "\n",
    "For a qualitative understanding, we can visualize which blocks are selected by MoBA's gating mechanism. The plot below shows an example with a single attention head on a sequence of length 64 (block size 8). Each point indicates that the query token at a given position attends to the block indexed on the y-axis. As expected, every query attends to its own block (points along the diagonal), and also to a few additional blocks (off-diagonal points) based on content. This dynamic selection illustrates how MoBA can focus on relevant distant information while preserving local context.\n"

    "In this notebook, we implemented the Mixture of Block Attention (MoBA) mechanism and demonstrated its integration into Transformer models. We verified that MoBA can significantly improve attention efficiency on long sequences and saw how it dynamically selects relevant blocks of context for each query. The example training task showed that a MoBA-based model can be trained similarly to a standard Transformer. MoBA provides a promising solution for scaling Transformers to longer inputs by balancing flexibility and efficiency.\n"
