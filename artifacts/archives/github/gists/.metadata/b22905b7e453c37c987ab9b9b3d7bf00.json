  "description": "This report detailed a **comprehensive** and **autonomous** ReAct-based theorem-proving system, orchestrated by LangGraph, that aims to **push** the limits of conventional ATP. By leveraging iterative reasoning, external knowledge, and a validation mechanism, the system either produces a plausible proof or disproof. Future directions include integrating formal proof assistants, adding multi-step heuristics, and refining the approach to handle extremely large or novel statements. We hope this fully documented code and research framework catalyzes additional exploration and innovation in automated theorem proving.",
