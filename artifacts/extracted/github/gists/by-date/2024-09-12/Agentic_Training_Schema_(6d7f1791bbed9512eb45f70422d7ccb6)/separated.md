### Summary of Benefits

- **Improved Readability**: Each JSON file now focuses on a specific aspect of the model configuration, making it easier to read and maintain.
- **Easier Maintenance**: Modular files allow for updates without affecting other components.
- **Reusability**: Each component (e.g., agentic approaches or dataset schemas) can be reused in other models or configurations.
- **Version Control**: Tracking changes and collaborating is now simpler, as each component can be individually versioned.
