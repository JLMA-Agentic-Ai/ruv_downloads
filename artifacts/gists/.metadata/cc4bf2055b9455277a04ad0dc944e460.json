  "description": "QuDAG Vault is a Rust-based password and secret manager built on a quantum-resistant DAG architecture. It uses Kyber for key exchange, Dilithium for signatures, and AES-256-GCM for encrypting vault data. Secrets are stored as encrypted nodes in a DAG, enabling flexible organization, versioning, and delegation. It includes a CLI and bindings for Node.js (via napi-rs) and Python (via PyO3). Designed for extensibility, it supports future features like MFA, RBAC, and distributed vault replication.",
