  "description": "Leveraging advanced language models (LLMs) has become integral to enhancing coding efficiency and accuracy. Aider introduces a groundbreaking approach by **separating code reasoning from code editing**, utilizing two specialized models to tackle each aspect of the coding process. This bifurcation not only optimizes performance but also leverages the unique strengths of different models to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in code editing tasks.",
